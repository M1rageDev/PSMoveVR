# PSMoveVR

PSMoveVR is a software set which allows usage of the PSMove controllers as normal SteamVR devices. It consists of the Core, which does most of the tracking work and the Driver, which communicates with the Core and passes data to SteamVR.

This package is still very new and not finished at all, but I've got the Python version of it running fantastic. Head to [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4RB2ipeyjkX6UHJL9HfIOQ) channel to see footage of both the old and new versions.

This is like the fourth rewrite of the original PSMoveVR program. I am going absolutely insane. The first C++ version was a complete mess, that's why I left it and decided to rewrite it AGAIN. It's going great so far, I have a normal project structure which is easy to follow and my IDE is setup for my workflow.
